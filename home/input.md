An input component is a device that allows the user to send a signal or data into an electronic system.


### Mechanical Inputs
Mechanical components that can be utilized to open or close a circuit or activate specific functions within an electronic system.

- [Switches *Coming soon*](/home/input/switches)
- [Buttons *Coming soon*](/home/input/buttons)

### Sensors
Sensors can detect changes in the surrounding environment and convert them into electrical signals for use by an electronic system.

- [Temperature/humidity sensors *A temperature/humidity sensor is a device that measures and reports the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment. It typically consists of a small chip or sensor element that detects changes in temperature and/or humidity and converts these changes into electrical signals that can be processed and displayed.*](/home/input/temperaturesensors)
- [Light sensors *Coming soon*](/home/input/lightsensors)
- [Motion sensors *Coming soon*](/home/input/motionsensors)
- [Utrasonic sensors *An ultrasonic sensor is a type of sensor that uses sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing (typically above 20 kHz) to detect the distance to, or presence of, an object.*](/home/input/utrasonicsensors)

### Variable Inputs
Variable inputs can be adjusted to control the level of a signal or the volume of an audio output.

- [Potentiometers *Coming soon*](/home/input/potentiometers)
- [Variable resistors *Coming soon*](/home/input/variableresistors)

### Audio Inputs
Audio inputs are components that convert sound waves into electrical signals for processing or recording audio.

- [Microphones *Coming soon*](/home/input/microphones)
- [XLR Inputs *Coming soon*](/home/input/xlrinputs)

### Digital Inputs
Digital inputs are input devices utilized for digital input and interaction with electronic devices. 

- [Touchscreens *Coming soon*](/home/input/touchscreens)
- [Keyboards *Coming soon*](/home/input/keyboards)
