An input component is a device that allows the user to send a signal or data into an electronic system.

### Mechanical Inputs
Mechanical components that can be utilized to open or close a circuit or activate specific functions within an electronic system.

- [Switches *Coming soon*](/home/input/switches)  

- [Buttons *Coming soon*](/home/input/buttons)

### Sensors
Sensors can detect changes in the surrounding environment and convert them into electrical signals for use by an electronic system.

- [Motion sensors *Coming soon*](/home/input/motionsensors)
-->
- [RGBSensor](/home/input/RGBsensor)
- [Tilt Sensor *Tilt sensors allow you to detect orientation or inclination. They are small, inexpensive, low-power and easy-to-use. If used properly, they will not wear out. Their simplicitiy makes them popular for toys, gadgets and appliances.*](/home/input/tiltsensor)
- [Temperature/humidity sensors *A temperature/humidity sensor is a device that measures and reports the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment. It typically consists of a small chip or sensor element that detects changes in temperature and/or humidity and converts these changes into electrical signals that can be processed and displayed.*](/home/input/temperaturesensors)
- [Infrared sensors *An IR distance sensor (short for Infrared distance sensor) is a device that can measure the distance between itself and an object using infrared light. It emits a beam of infrared light and measures the time it takes for the light to reflect off an object and return to the sensor.*](/home/input/infraredsensors)
- [Utrasonic sensors *An ultrasonic sensor is a type of sensor that uses sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing (typically above 20 kHz) to detect the distance to, or presence of, an object.*](/home/input/utrasonicsensors)
- [PhotoResistor *A photoresistor, also known as a photocell, is an electronic component that senses the amount of light in its environment and changes its resistance accordingly.*](/home/input/photoresistor)
- [Pulse Sensor *The Pulse Sensor is a well-designed low-power plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for the Arduino. The pulse sensor shines light through the skin and measures the reflection with the photodetector. The working of the sensor can be divided into two parts, one is heart rate measurement and another is blood oxygen level measurement.*](/home/input/photoresistor)

### Variable Inputs
Variable inputs can be adjusted to control the level of a signal or the volume of an audio output.

- [Potentiometers *Coming soon*](/home/input/potentiometers)
- [Variable resistors *Coming soon*](/home/input/variableresistors)

### Audio Inputs
Audio inputs are components that convert sound waves into electrical signals for processing or recording audio.

- [Microphones *A Microphone sensor helps an electronic product capture sound waves and convert that energy into electrical energy so it can be processed and used in various applications.*](/home/input/microphones)
- [XLR Inputs *Coming soon*](/home/input/xlrinputs)

### Digital Inputs
Digital inputs are input devices utilized for digital input and interaction with electronic devices. 

- [Touchscreens *Coming soon*](/home/input/touchscreens)
- [Keyboards *Coming soon*](/home/input/keyboards)
